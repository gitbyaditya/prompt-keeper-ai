## 💡 Notes for Beginners

This project is intentionally simple — designed to help junior devs explore Alpine.js, localStorage, and how to use Express to serve a frontend app. If you’ve never hosted your own front-end with Node.js before, this is a great place to start!

## 🌱 Development Phase

This is still an early build. Currently focusing on core prompt input and layout. Next steps include:

* Tag-based categorization system
* Prompt searching/filtering
* Backup/export functionality
* Drag-and-drop reordering

Feel free to fork or contribute!

## 🧸 Author Notes

> This app was born from my own habit of collecting prompts — ideas for writing, tools, or fun experiments. I often lost track of them, so I built this little keeper. It’s small, quiet, and here to help. Hope it helps you too.
